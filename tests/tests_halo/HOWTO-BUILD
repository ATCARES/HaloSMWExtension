    TODOs for BUILD in the !internal! build system
###################################################################################################

Create branches of the following projects

HaloSMWExtension (SVN)
SMWPlusInstaller (CVS)
XAMPP (CVS)

#
# Hudson job copies
#

Create copies of the following jobs:

Build SMWHalo (the Halo extensions and friends)
Build SMWHaloInstaller (the Windows installer version)
Build SMWHalo Installer Tools (containing SMWPlusInstaller and XAMPP)

Adjust in HaloSMWExtension/build.nsi on the branch
Replace 'SMWHalo Installer Tools' by the job name you selected for the copy.

#
# Release view in Hudson
#
Create a Hudson view and add these new jobs to the view. Name it like this: Release yyyy-mm-dd

#
# Deployment
#

The following adjustments are necessary for the deployment:
Make sure the deploy descritptors are valid. Correct version, correct configs. Each
extension must have one if it should be installable via the DF.

#
# Testing
#

The following things must be adjusted for the testing infrastructure:

*Add option -Dwikipath=<path> at webtest call in buildsystem config to make sure which wiki is used.
*Change $wgScriptPath in tests/tests_halo/LocalSettingsForTest.php template to /releaseXXX where XXX is
the release number.
*Create new HTTP alias for /releaseXXX on testing machine pointing to the directory of the HaloSMWExtension branch.


#
# Misc
#

The TSC must be updated to the latest version on the internal buildsystem. This does not happen
automatically. Usually it is sufficient to just copy the lib folders.

#
# Lucene 
#
Usually you don't need to create a job copy of Lucene because it does not change. You may use the head version
as predefined. If you branch it, you have to make sure to do the adjustment:

HaloSMWExtension/build.nsi:
Replace 'Build Lucene server' by the name of the copied job.
