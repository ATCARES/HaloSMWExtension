== Important notice about modifiactions ==

For the Halo project we use the NewUserMessage extension in the SMW+
installation. The released version of the NewUserMessage is modified by
Ontoprise to fit into the SMW+ installation.

When a user registeres himself in the wiki, a new user page is created. This
page is by default in the User_talk namespce. In SMW+ we want this page to be
in the user namespace, but not the talk page. Therefore we apply the patch
to the file NewUserMessage.class.php to implement the described behaviour. This
change may break functionality when the NewUserMessage extension is used together
with the LiquidThreads extension. In the standard SMW+ installation the
LiquidThreads extension is not in use.
