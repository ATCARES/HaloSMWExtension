Configure a triplestore
=======================

Add to LocalSettings.php:

    $smwgHaloWebserviceEndpoint="localhost:8080";  // localhost:8080 is default of TSC

For productive systems, add also:

    $smwgHaloTSCKnowsDBCredentials = true;

This options makes sure that the DB credentials are not sent during sync. Instead 
you must specify them in the TSC's config file. This is STRONGLY recommended for 
productive systems. Don't forget the setting TSC.WikiDBCredentials=<user>:<password>
in tsc.properties.
    
Optional:

(1) 
    $smwgHaloTripleStoreGraph = 'graph-uri';

graph-uri is an arbitrary URI which works as an identifier for the wiki in the
TSC. Every URI is possible as long as it does not contain a hash character (#).
If it is not set 'http://mywiki' is the default.

(2) 

If the webserver requires (Basic) HTTP authorization, add:

    $smwgHaloWebserviceUser = "username";
    $smwgHaloWebservicePassword = "password";

You may now initialize the TSC on the page Special:TSA. Refer to the triplestore
documentation for a better way of initialization.


Non-existing pages
==================
$smwgHaloNEPEnabled=true;

activates a feature which displays facts about an instance only available in the 
triplestore. It is enabled whenever a red-link is selected.


Quad mode
=========
$smwgHaloQuadMode=true;
Activate this if the TS works in quad mode.
