Installation instructions
-------------------------

Requirements: 
    MediaWiki 1.13 or higher
    SMW 1.4.2 
    Lucene server 2.0 or 2.1 (the version deployed on SMWHalo's page on sourceforge runs on Windows too!)

Run:
php {wiki-path}/extensions/UnifiedSearch/maintenance/setup.php

Then add to your LocalSettings.php:

---
$wgSearchType = 'LuceneSearch';
$wgLuceneHost = 'localhost';
$wgLucenePort = 8123;
$wgLuceneSearchVersion = 2.1; 
require_once("extensions/UnifiedSearch/UnifiedSearch.php");
---

If you like to use query expansion based on synonym sets from WordNet/OpenThesaurus, also add:
---
$usgSynsetExpansion = true;
---


Run the LuceneServer

That's it.
