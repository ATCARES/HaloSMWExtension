== Disclaimer ==

There is no guarantee that any of Semantic Forms' functionality will
work on your system. On the other hand, the code does not make any
modifications to the database directly, so it should be a low-risk
installation.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 1.0 or
greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's own
installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticForms" that contains
    all relevant files. Copy this directory (or extract/download it) to
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/SemanticForms/includes/SF_Settings.php');

'''Remark:'''  Semantic Forms creates an additional custom namespace, "Form"
(see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Using_custom_namespaces). If you have your
own custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter $sfgNamespaceIndex before
including SF_Settings.php. See SF_Settings.php for more details.

== Install patches ==

If you want to use Semantic Forms together with the extensions HaloACL, RichMedia,
SMWHalo or WYSIWYG you have to install patches for these extensions. If you install
the extensions after Semantic Forms you can skip the installation of patches here
with the exception of the patch for Semantic Forms itself.
Otherwise you should install the appropriate patches. The patches are located in
the folder "patches" of the Semantic forms extension. The tools for patching are
patch.php and patch.exe. They are located in the root folder of the extension.
Please open a command line there for the following steps. Replace <mediawiki-dir>
by the absolute path to your MediaWiki installation in the given commands.
