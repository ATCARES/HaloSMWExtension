Data Import extension ChangeLog
===============================


VERSION 1.3.2

  CHANGES:
    * Query Interface popup has not tabs anymore because in the SMWHalo
      extension 1.5.1 the query interface will support modifying the query
      source directly.
      Use this version only if you have the SMWHalo extension 1.5.1 installed.
    * A define has been added so that other extensions may easily check whether
      the WYSIWYG extension is available or not.
