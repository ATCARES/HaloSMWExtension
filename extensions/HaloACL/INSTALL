Installation instructions for HaloACL extension v1.1.1
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements: 
=============

    MediaWiki 1.13.2 or 1.15.1 - 1.15.3
    SMW 1.5.0 (optional)
    Semantic Forms 1.9 (optional)

Installation:
=============

The easiest way to install HaloACL is using the deployment framework:

 smwadmin -i haloacl

This installs the extension and patches MediaWiki and SMW.

For a manual installation, you have to copy the folder HaloACL into 
the extensions folder of MediaWiki. HaloACL will then already work, if you 
activate it in LocalSetting.php (see below). 

However, you can apply two patches:
* patch_for_MW_1.13.2.txt or patch_for_MW_1.15.1.txt or patch_for_MW_1.15.3.txt: 
	This patch for MediaWiki removes all links to protected pages from 
	the rendered articles and listings. If a link can not be removed, it is 
	replaced by a link to the page 'Permission denied'. This patch is optional.
* patch_for_SMW_1.5.0.txt: 
	This patch for SMW 1.5.0 is mandatory, if you want to protect the values of 
	semantic properties.
* patch_for_SF_1.9.txt:
	This patch for Semantic Forms 1.9 is mandatory, if you want to protect the 
	values of semantic properties in semantic forms and if you want to use the
	HaloACL toolbar in forms.
These patch files were created in Eclipse. They can be installed using the tool
patch.php from the deploy framework (smwhalo-deploy-1.0) which itself uses GNU
patch. The patch.php is also included in this extension. Go into the root
directory of the extension and run the following command:
 php patch.php -p <patch-file> -d <mediawiki-dir> --onlypatch

Updating the database
---------------------

The HaloACL extension requires some additional tables in the database that must
be added to the existing database schema. Existing data will not be modified.
Therefore change into the maintenance folder of the HaloACL extension and run the
setup script:
 cd /folder_to_mediawiki/extension/HaloACL/maintenance
 php HACL_Setup.php


Activating HaloACL
------------------

The extension is activated by adding the following lines to LocalSettings.php:

include_once('extensions/HaloACL/includes/HACL_Initialize.php');
enableHaloACL(); 


Options:
========

All configuration options are defined and described in HACL_Initialize.php.
