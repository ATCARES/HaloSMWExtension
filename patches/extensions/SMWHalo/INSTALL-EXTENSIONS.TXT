== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without
making any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you
can try out the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall
mechanism is provided). Every serious wiki should be subject to regular 
database backups! If you have any specific questions, please contact 
the authors.

=== Testing your Installation ===

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps to
check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see the chosen extensions (version nn) listed.


If you don't get these results, check the steps in the installation section, consult
